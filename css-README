26. When using position: fixed;, be careful of how position of other elements might not make sense,
For example, in below, the position of green div looks odd, because it is inside body and body has an 8px margin
whereas, div.black has been fixed position to be at 0px from the top of the viewport.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
div.black {
  position: fixed;
  height: 200px;
  top: 0px;
  border: 3px solid black;
} 

div.green {
  left: 0px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="black">black</div>
<div class="green">green</div>

</body>
</html>
